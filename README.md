- I believe that inclusion in software development is incredibly important so that we can better reflect the complexity of reality

- 🎥💥 I'm a thinkerer by nature, currently working in the VFX industry as a Pipeline TD

- 👨🏻‍🎨 My background is a mixed bag of Humanities and Computer Science that finds its peak in Computational Arts. As you've guessed, computer code to me it's much more that just instructions for machines

- 🐍 Python and a good shell (zsh, bash, tcsh even..) are my dearest friends right now. In the past I also hung out with C++/JS/Java (in decreasing order of love)

- 👨🏻‍💻 If you're into Openframeworks, Cinder, Processing or Threejs then let's get in touch!

- 🤖 Physical Computing is where the real fun is!

- 🎨 Things I did:
